Lift gamma gain plugin, is a plugin made to achieve a good and fast post processing effect on your game. 

## How to use the plugin
It is quite simple:

* Open the tab of the plugin (you will find it on the bottom, where there are the Output, Debug and etc...) 
* Now you need to write the name of the **World environment** node if is different compared with default one of the plugin  (in my case the name of world environment was Scene Root)
